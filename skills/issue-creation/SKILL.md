## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating a GitHub issue (bug report or feature request)
- Helping a contributor file an issue
- Triaging or approving issues as a maintainer

---

## Critical Rules

1. **Blank issues are disabled** — MUST use a template (bug report or feature request)
2. **Every issue gets `status:needs-review` automatically** on creation
3. **A maintainer MUST add `status:approved`** before any PR can be opened
4. **Questions go to the repository's Discussions area when available**, not issues
5. **Never run GitHub write operations unless the user explicitly asked for them in this message and confirmed immediately before execution**
6. **Verify issue templates, labels, and Discussions support exist before relying on them**

---

## Workflow

```
1. Search existing issues for duplicates
2. Verify the repository has the expected issue templates and labels
3. Ask for confirmation before any GitHub write command
4. Choose the correct template (Bug Report or Feature Request)
5. Fill in ALL required fields
6. Check pre-flight checkboxes
7. Submit → issue gets status:needs-review automatically
8. Wait for maintainer to add status:approved
9. Only then open a PR linking this issue
```

## Issue Templates

### Bug Report

Template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` if present in the current repository
Auto-labels: `bug`, `status:needs-review`

#### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pre-flight Checks** | Checkboxes: no duplicate + understands approval workflow |
| **Bug Description** | Clear description of the bug |
| **Steps to Reproduce** | Numbered steps to reproduce |
| **Expected Behavior** | What should have happened |
| **Actual Behavior** | What happened instead (include errors/logs) |
| **Operating System** | Dropdown: macOS, Linux variants, Windows, WSL |
| **Agent / Client** | Dropdown: Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Codex, Other |
| **Shell** | Dropdown: bash, zsh, fish, Other |

#### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Relevant Logs** | Log output (auto-formatted as code block) |
| **Additional Context** | Screenshots, workarounds, extra info |

#### Example — Bug Report via CLI

```bash
gh issue create --template "bug_report.yml" \
  --title "fix(scripts): setup.sh fails on zsh with glob error" \
  --body "
### Pre-flight Checks
- [x] I have searched existing issues and this is not a duplicate
- [x] I understand this issue needs status:approved before a PR can be opened

### Bug Description
Running setup.sh on zsh throws a glob error when no matching files exist.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repo
2. Run \`./scripts/setup.sh\` in zsh
3. See error: \`zsh: no matches found: skills/*\`

### Expected Behavior
The script should handle missing glob matches gracefully.

### Actual Behavior
Script crashes with glob error.

### Operating System
macOS

### Agent / Client
Claude Code

### Shell
zsh

### Relevant Logs
\`\`\`
zsh: no matches found: skills/*
\`\`\`
"
```

---

### Feature Request

Template: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` if present in the current repository
Auto-labels: `enhancement`, `status:needs-review`

#### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pre-flight Checks** | Checkboxes: no duplicate + understands approval workflow |
| **Problem Description** | The pain point this feature solves |
| **Proposed Solution** | How it should work from the user's perspective |
| **Affected Area** | Dropdown: Scripts, Skills, Examples, Documentation, CI/Workflows, Other |

#### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Alternatives Considered** | Other approaches or workarounds |
| **Additional Context** | Mockups, examples, references |

#### Example — Feature Request via CLI

```bash
gh issue create --template "feature_request.yml" \
  --title "feat(scripts): add Codex support to setup.sh" \
  --body "
### Pre-flight Checks
- [x] I have searched existing issues and this is not a duplicate
- [x] I understand this issue needs status:approved before a PR can be opened

### Problem Description
The setup script only configures Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode. Codex users have to manually copy skills.

### Proposed Solution
Add a Codex option to setup.sh that links skills to the .codex/ directory.

Example:
\`\`\`bash
./scripts/setup.sh --agent codex
\`\`\`

### Affected Area
Scripts (setup, installation)

### Alternatives Considered
Manually symlinking, but that defeats the purpose of the setup script.

## Label System

### Applied Automatically on Issue Creation

| Template | Labels added |
|----------|-------------|
| Bug Report | `bug`, `status:needs-review` |
| Feature Request | `enhancement`, `status:needs-review` |

### Applied by Maintainers

| Label | When to apply |
|-------|--------------|
| `status:approved` | Issue accepted for implementation — PRs can now be opened |
| `priority:high` | Critical bug or urgent feature |
| `priority:medium` | Important but not blocking |
| `priority:low` | Nice to have |

---

## Maintainer Approval Workflow

```
1. New issue arrives with status:needs-review
2. Review the issue — is it valid, clear, and in scope?
3. If YES → add status:approved label
4. If NO → comment with reason, close if needed
5. Contributor can now open a PR linking this issue
```

---

## Decision Tree

```
Is it a bug?                    → Use Bug Report template
Is it a new feature/improvement? → Use Feature Request template
Is it a question?               → Use Discussions, NOT issues
Is it a duplicate?              → Link to existing issue, close
```

---

## Commands

```bash
# Search existing issues before creating
gh issue list --search "keyword"

# Create bug report
gh issue create --template "bug_report.yml" --title "fix(scope): description"

# Create feature request
gh issue create --template "feature_request.yml" --title "feat(scope): description"

# Maintainer: approve an issue
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "status:approved"

# Maintainer: add priority
gh issue edit <number> --add-label "priority:high"
```
